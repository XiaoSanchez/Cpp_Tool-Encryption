# C++ Tool: Encryption And Decryption

This tool inplements some basics of cryptography namely encryption and decryption techniques, and fundation to build an encryption application and created an encryption application where can be used this application module in  future app.
## Appendix


The main focus on three objectives:
- basics of encryptions 
- encryption algorithms 
- encryption application development
- caesar cipher
- caesar cipher to encrypt a plaintext
- caesar cipher for decryption
